## Implementation Notes

### API Integration Strategy

For Phase 2, we'll need to:
1. Identify all relevant API endpoints in the Ainimate app
2. Create a proper API client with authentication
3. Map MCP tools to API calls
4. Implement proper error handling and response parsing

### Testing Strategy

For each phase:
1. Create unit tests for all tools and prompts
2. Implement integration tests with the Ainimate app
3. Test with Claude for Desktop and other MCP clients
4. Gather user feedback and iterate

### Documentation

For each phase:
1. Update README with new tools and prompts
2. Create examples and tutorials
3. Document API integration details
4. Provide troubleshooting guides
